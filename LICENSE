The files in the glue sub-directory comes from gnu-efi's gnuefi sub directories. Most of the files contain appropriate licensing but for the files lacking README.gnuefi states:

[...]
 gnuefi: This directory contains the glue necessary to convert ELF64
  binaries to EFI binaries.  Various runtime code bits, such as
    a self-relocator are included as well.  This code has been
    contributed by the Hewlett-Packard Company and is distributed
    under the GNU GPL.
